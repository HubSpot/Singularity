## Changes in `0.4.6`

Check out the [0.4.6 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A0.4.6+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### New Features
 - [Shell commands](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/515) using the singularity executor. You can read more about the shell commands feature [here](../features/shell-commands.md)
 - Introduce an [incremental bounce](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/767). An incremental bounce will kill old tasks as new tasks become healthy instead of witing for all new tasks to be healthy before shutting down old tasks. This is especially useful when running services with many instances on a lean cluster. The option is available in the ui when asking to bounce, or by adding a query param of `incremental=true` to your `POST` request to the `/request/{requestId}/bounce` endpoint.

   - SingularityOOMKiller
   - SingularityLogWatcher
  
 If you use any of these, please [convert](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/blob/7bbdb4c190292813edc4585a5fb4edb4dcafefe6/Docs/slave_extras.md) your configuration to the `.yaml` style.
