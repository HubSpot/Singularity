## Changes in `0.13.0`

Check out the [0.13.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A0.13.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### New Features

*[1342](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1342) - Introduce expiring machine state changes*

On the `Slaves` and `Racks` pages in the UI, there is now an `Expiration` field present when initiating a state change. When a duration is specified here, the slave or rack will revert to the specified state after time has elapsed. Note that if another state change takes place before the expiration time, the expiration will only remain active if the resulting state transition is still valid.

For example, if decommissioning a slave with an expiration of 1 minute, with a `evertToState` of `ACTIVE`, it is possible the slave will finish decommissioning in that time. So, it's state would change from `DECOMMISSIONING` to `DECOMMISSIONED`. In this case, the expiring action will remain active, because `DECOMMISSIONED` -> `ACTIVE` is still a valid state change.

*[1219](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1219) - Starred requests persistence*

User settings (so far only starred requests) are now stored server-side instead of client-side in `localStorage`. If a username is not found, you will be prompted for a username when you first load the ui. Any starred requests you currently have in `localStorage` will automatically be migrated to the server-side storage.
