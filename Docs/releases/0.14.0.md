## Changes in `0.14.0`

Check out the [0.14.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A0.14.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

## Important

The next release of Singularity (`0.15.0`) will include an upgrade to java 8.

## Configuration Changes

[#1391](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1391) include a rework of some of the S3 settings in Singularity. If you use the `SingularityExecutor` or `SingularityExecutorCleanup` modules and use the S3 upload features, you will need an update to your configuration. The fields for specifying which files to upload have been moved out of the `SingularityExecutor`. An example below shows all fields that would move.

Old Configuration (gets removed from `SingularityExecutor` and `SingularityExecutorCleanup` yaml files)
```yaml
executor:
  s3UploaderBucket: my-logs-bucket
  s3UploaderKeyPattern: "%requestId/%Y/%m/%taskId_%index-%s-%filename"
  s3UploaderAdditionalFiles:
    - access.log
  s3StorageClass: "STANDARD_IA"
  applyS3StorageClassAfterBytes: 75000
```

New Configuration (if not already present for use with S3 log searching)
```yaml
# in SingularityExecutorCleanup yaml configuration
executorCleanup:
  defaultS3Bucket: my-logs-bucket
  s3KeyFormat: "%requestId/%Y/%m/%taskId_%index-%s-%filename"
  s3StorageClass: "STANDARD_IA"
  applyS3StorageClassAfterBytes: 75000
  s3UploaderAdditionalFiles:
   - filename: access.log
     # The default directory in the executor was set to 'logs', now it must be manually specified
     # If not specified, the directory to search for log files will be the task app directory in the sandbox
     directory: logs

# in SingularityService yaml configuration
s3:
  s3Bucket: my-logs-bucket
  s3KeyFormat: "%requestId/%Y/%m/%taskId_%index-%s-%filename"
  s3StorageClass: "STANDARD_IA"
  applyS3StorageClassAfterBytes: 75000
  s3UploaderAdditionalFiles:
   - filename: access.log
     # The default directory in the executor was set to 'logs', now it must be manually specified
     # If not specified, the directory to search for log files will be the task app directory in the sandbox
     directory: logs
```

**NOTE** - To upgrade smoothly, it is strongly recommended to deploy `SingularityService` and the `SingularityExecutorCleanup` *before* deploying the `SingularityExecutor`

### New Features
- [1306](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1306) - Smarter Healthchecks

Singularity healthchecks are now split into two phases. Previous settings will continue to function but are deprecated. Health check options are now specified in the [`healthcheck` object](../reference/apidocs/models.md#model-HealthcheckOptions) on the `SingularityDeploy` See [The new documentation](../reference/healthchecks.md) for more on updates to healthchecks.
