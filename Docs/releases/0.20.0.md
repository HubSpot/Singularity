## Changes in `0.20.0`

Check out the [0.20.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/milestone/35) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### Configuration Changes

[#1784](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1784) simplified the configuration for the weighting of different resources when evaluating offers. An old version of the config would look like:

```yaml
mesos:
  longRunningFreeResourceWeight: 0.5
  longRunningUsedResourceWeight: 0.5
  nonLonRunningFreeResourceWeight: 0.5
  nonLongRunningUsedResourceWeight: 0.5
  scoringStrategy: SPREAD_TASK_USAGE

longRunningUsedCpuWeightForOffer: 0.25
longRunningUsedMemWeightForOffer: 0.65
longRunningUsedDiskWeightForOffer: 0.1
freeCpuWeightForOffer: 0.25
freeMemWeightForOffer: 0.65
freeDiskWeightForOffer: 0.1
defaultOfferScoreForMissingUsage: 0.3
maxNonLongRunningUsedResourceWeight: 0.5
considerNonLongRunningTaskLongRunningAfterRunningForSeconds: 3600
```

The new simplified config is now (defaults are shown):

```yaml
mesos:
  allocatedResourceWeight: 0.5
  inUseResourceWeight: 0.5
  cpuWeight: 0.4
  memWeight: 0.4
  diskWeight: 0.2
```

Default behavior remains the same while eliminating complexity in the scoring system for evaluating offers

### New Features

- Singularity now has new api docs ([PR link](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1736)) powered by an updated version of swagger and using open api 3.0. A page is available in the UI when running Singularity to view the docs for the release you are currently running.
