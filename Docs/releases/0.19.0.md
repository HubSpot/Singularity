## Changes in `0.19.0`

Check out the [0.19.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A%0.19.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### New Features 

- [1668](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1668)/[1650](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1650) Adds support for more overrides in run now requests. You can now override items like environment variables for individual runs of a SingularityRequest by `POST`ing json in the form of a [`SingularityRunNowRequest`](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/blob/master/SingularityBase/src/main/java/com/hubspot/singularity/api/SingularityRunNowRequest.java)
- [1690](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1690) - Adds initial support for Mesos containers, with volume sources and network mapping. These can be specified
in the `containerInfo.volumes` and `containerInfo.mesos.image` sections of the [`SingularityContainerInfo`](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/blob/master/SingularityBase/src/main/java/com/hubspot/mesos/SingularityContainerInfo.java) in your [`SingularityDeploy`](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/blob/master/SingularityBase/src/main/java/com/hubspot/singularity/SingularityDeploy.java)
- [1702](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1702) - Updates the internal locking scheme for Singularity to allow more parallel processing. As a result, the concurrency of offer and status update processing can now be tuned, with increased concurrency coming with a cost of increased memory/cpu usage by the scheduler. The following parameters in the `mesos` section of the `SingularityConfiguration` impact concurrency and tuning of the scheduler:
	- `statusUpdateConcurrencyLimit` - The number of status updates that can be processed in parallel. Defaults to 500 and is backed by its own cached thread pool
	- `maxStatusUpdateQueueSize` - A semaphore limits the number of submissions to the status update cached thread pool. If there are currently no more permits available (i.e. > `statusUpdateConcurrencyLimit` status updates), these are added to a queue where they wait until more capacity is available. This configuration parameter controls teh max size of that queue. It is recommended that this be set a bit above the maximum number of tasks you expect to have active in Singularity at any one time, due to the fact that during reconciliation a status update for each task is sent in rapid succession.
	- `offersConcurrencyLimit` - The number of offer scoring calculations and checks to be done in parallel. Defaults to 100. This should generally not need to be updated.
