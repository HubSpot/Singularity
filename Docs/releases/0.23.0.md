## Changes in `0.23.0`

Check out the [0.23.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A%0.23.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail. `0.23.0` in general represents a number of performance improvements in relation to Singularity's usage of zookeeper and mysql as well as a mesos version bump.

## Migrations

***MySQL/Postgres***

`0.23.0` contains multiple database migrations (https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1928 + https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1956). These must be run *BEFORE* deploying the new version of SingularityService and are compatible with the running 0.22.0 release. You can check out our [docs on migrations](http://getsingularity.com/Docs/reference/database.html) to run these with liquibase. If you manage a larger installation of Singularity utilizaing mysql (e.g. millions of tasks in task history), we recommend running the migrations using pt-online-schema-change to minimize interruptions. Migrations and ptosc arguments are listed below for convinience:

- Addition of usage tracking table - This can be run with liquibase since it is a non-blocking migration and is the first changeSet in the new release. To run only a single changeSet in liquibase (e.g. to then run the remaining ones with ptosc), add the `--count 1` option when running `db migrate`
- Change requestHistory table charset + add json column - `--alter "CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin, MODIFY COLUMN request blob DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN requestId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN requestState ENUM ('CREATED', 'UPDATED', 'DELETING', 'DELETED', 'PAUSED', 'UNPAUSED', 'ENTERED_COOLDOWN', 'EXITED_COOLDOWN', 'FINISHED', 'DEPLOYED_TO_UNPAUSE', 'BOUNCED', 'SCALED', 'SCALE_REVERTED') NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN user varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN message varchar(280) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL, ADD COLUMN json JSON DEFAULT NULL"`
- Change deployHistory table charset + add json column - `--alter "CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin, MODIFY COLUMN bytes MEDIUMBLOB DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN requestId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN deployId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN user varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN message varchar(280) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN deployState ENUM ('SUCCEEDED', 'FAILED_INTERNAL_STATE', 'CANCELING', 'WAITING', 'OVERDUE', 'FAILED', 'CANCELED') NOT NULL, ADD COLUMN json JSON DEFAULT NULL"`
- Change taskHistory table charset/enums + add json column - `--alter "CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin, MODIFY COLUMN bytes MEDIUMBLOB DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN taskId varchar(200) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN requestId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN lastTaskStatus ENUM ('TASK_LAUNCHED', 'TASK_STAGING', 'TASK_STARTING', 'TASK_RUNNING', 'TASK_CLEANING', 'TASK_KILLING', 'TASK_FINISHED', 'TASK_FAILED', 'TASK_KILLED', 'TASK_LOST', 'TASK_LOST_WHILE_DOWN', 'TASK_ERROR', 'TASK_DROPPED', 'TASK_GONE', 'TASK_UNREACHABLE', 'TASK_GONE_BY_OPERATOR', 'TASK_UNKNOWN') NOT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN runId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin DEFAULT NULL, MODIFY COLUMN deployId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin DEFAULT NULL, ADD COLUMN json JSON DEFAULT NULL, ADD KEY requestDeployUpdated (requestId, deployId, updatedAt), ADD KEY hostUpdated (host, updatedAt)"`
- Change taskUsage table charset - `--alter "CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8, MODIFY COLUMN requestId varchar(100) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT '', MODIFY COLUMN taskId varchar(200) CHARACTER SET ascii COLLATE ascii_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT ''"`

As seen above, these migrations prep Singularity to use mysql's json data type instead of a blob for history storage. All net-new history will be stored in the json format and old lob columns are not yet dropped. Singularity will look for either format currently when fetching individual task histories. You can kick off a backfill of data from blob -> json format by sending an http POST to the `/api/history/sql-backfill?batchSize=20` endpoint on SingularityService (batch size is configurable to balance resources vs speed). If Singularity need to restart/etc, this process is idempotent and can be kicked off as many times as needed, though only one invocation can run at a time.

***Zookeeper***

On startup, Singularity will run a number of migrations to zookeeper task data. These are aimed at reducing the possible size of any single zookeeper read. You may notice that the first startup of the new Singularity release is slower due to these changes running. This migration is idempotent and will be re-attempted on next startup if it should fail.

## Mesos Version Upgrade

Singularity `0.23.0` is build against mesos 1.8, but should be compatible with all earlier 1.x versions of mesos
