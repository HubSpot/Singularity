## Changes in `0.12.0`

Check out the [0.12.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A0.12.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### Migrations

[#1283](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/#1283) (Change deployHistory bytes to a MEDIUMBLOB), [#1316](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/#1316) (Expand requestHistory.createdAt column to millisecond precision), and [#1319](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/#1319) (Make the history purger query more efficient), contain migrations.

If you have a large number of tasks in your database (e.g. more than 100k), it is possible that the last of these migrations ([#1319](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/#1319)) could be very slow when run via liquibase. If this is a concern, we recommend using [pt-online-schema-change](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.1/pt-online-schema-change.html) to run your migration.

In order to run your migration with `pt-online-schema-change`, the following command is equal to liquibase migration `14`.

```
pt-online-schema-change \
  --user=(your db user) \
  --ask-pass \
  --alter "ADD COLUMN purged BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false, ADD KEY purged (requestId, purged, updatedAt)" \
  --execute \
  D=(your database name),t=taskHistory
```
