## Changes in `1.0.0`

Singularity has been running our production infrastructure at HubSpot for years and the team is happy to announce a (probably long overdue) `1.0.0` release. Check out the [1.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/milestone/41?closed=1) to see new changes in detail.

## Breaking Changes

Singularity `1.0.0` includes a pile of tech debt cleanup. The most significant of these is a move from the deprecated guava `Optional` to the newer `java.util.Optional`. Any java clients using the `SingularityBase` or `SingularityClient` modules will need to update appropriately. While very similar, the two `Optional`s are not binary compatible. [This article](https://medium.com/@edouard.kaiser/optional-guava-and-java-8-9d6e7d6147b0) breifly explains a few of the differences.
