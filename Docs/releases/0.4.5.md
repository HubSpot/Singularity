## Changes in `0.4.5`

Check out the [0.4.5 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A0.4.5+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

- Singularity 0.4.5 bumps its Mesos dependency from 0.21.0 to 0.23.0. [#657](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/657)
- If upgrading from a version prior to 0.4.4, you will need to run database migrations. Refer to [the database docs](../reference/database.md#schema-changes) for how to run migrations before starting the new version of Singularity.


### Deprecated
- The `.properties` configuration format for Singularity slave helpers:
  
  - SingularityExecutor
  - SingularityExecutorCleanup
  - SingularityS3Downloader
  - SingularityS3Uploader
  - SingularityOOMKiller
  - SingularityLogWatcher
  
  If you use any of these, please [convert](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/blob/7bbdb4c190292813edc4585a5fb4edb4dcafefe6/Docs/slave_extras.md) your configuration to the `.yaml` style.

  *`.properties` support will be removed completely in 0.4.6.*
