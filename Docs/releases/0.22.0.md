## Changes in `0.22.0`

Check out the [0.22.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/milestone/39?closed=1) to see new features / bugfixes in detail. `0.22.0` represents an [upgrade to mesos `1.6.1`](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1867). This also includes an upgrade to protobuf 3 and a move to a separate fork of mesos-rxjava. Instuctions for upgrading mesos can be found [here](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/upgrades/). In internal testing we found communications between old mesos master/upgraded scheduler and vice versa were both backwards compatible back to mesos `1.1.0`.
