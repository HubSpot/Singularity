## Changes in `0.15.0`

Check out the [0.15.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A%0.15.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### New Features
- [1519](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1519) - Spread to all slaves

Adds a best effort attempt to deploy a task on all slaves. You can enable this by adding `spreadAllSlavesEnabled: true` to your Singularity yaml file. You can then set `SPREAD_ALL_SLAVES` for the `placementStrategy` on a `SingularityRequest`.

- [1405](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1405) - Slave Usage Monitoring UI

In the Admin drop-down on the UI, there is now a `Slave Usage` monitoring page. This page contains visualizations about resource usages amongst all the slaves. The circular progress meters display the percent of total resources utilized on all slaves. The resources (cpu and memory) heat map displays percentage utilized per slave.

- [1456](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1456) - Bump to java 8/Jersey 2/Dropwizard 1

Singularity is now officially on java 8! As part of this upgrade we have also bumped some library versions. Most notably upgrading to Jersey 2 and Dropwizard 1

- [1253](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1253) - New Tailer

The Singularity log tailer got a makeover to improve performance and memory usage. Currently you can still toggle between old and new tailer versions, but this will be removed in future releases.
