## Changes in `0.4.9`

### Renamed endpoints
This endpoint was renamed:
- `/requests/request/{requestId}/instances` --> `/requests/request/{requestId}/scale`

These endpoints were renamed to fix a typo in the URL:
- `/racks/rack/{rackId}/decomission` --> `/racks/rack/{rackId}/decommission`
- `/slaves/slave/{rackId}/decomission` --> `/slaves/slave/{rackId}/decommission`

{% include "../features/expiring-actions.md" %}
